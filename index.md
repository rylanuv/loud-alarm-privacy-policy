        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Loud Alarm – Solve2Wake</p>
        <p class="effective-date"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 21, 2026</p>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Loud Alarm – Solve2Wake does <strong>not collect, store, transmit, or
                    share</strong> any personal data. All app data is stored locally on your device and never leaves it.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Loud Alarm – Solve2Wake</strong> ("we", "our", or "the App")
            handles information when you use our Android application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and
            being transparent about our data practices.
        </p>
        <p>
            By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>We do not collect any personal information.</strong> The App does not require an account, login, or
            any personal details to function. Specifically:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect your name, email address, phone number, or any personally
                identifiable information.</li>
            <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect location data.</li>
            <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect usage analytics or crash reports.</li>
            <li>We do <strong>not</strong> use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</li>
            <li>The App does <strong>not</strong> have internet access and cannot transmit any data off your device.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>3. Data Stored Locally on Your Device</h2>
        <p>
            The App stores the following data <strong>locally on your device only</strong> to provide its core
            functionality:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Alarm configurations:</strong> Time, days of the week, label, challenge type, math difficulty,
                barcode value, and volume boost preference.</li>
            <li><strong>Barcode images:</strong> If you use the Barcode Challenge feature, a photo of the barcode or QR
                code is captured and saved locally on your device. This image is used solely to help you identify and
                locate the physical barcode you need to scan to dismiss the alarm. These images are <strong>never
                    transmitted</strong> to any server or third party.</li>
            <li><strong>App settings:</strong> Vibration preference, snooze settings, alarm volume, fade-in duration,
                and dark mode preference.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This data is stored using Android's Room database and DataStore Preferences. It remains entirely on your
            device and is <strong>never transmitted</strong> to any server or third party. If you uninstall the App, all
            locally stored data is automatically deleted.
        </p>
        <h2>4. Camera Usage & Barcode Images</h2>
        <p>
            The App requests <strong>camera permission</strong> solely for the <strong>Barcode Challenge</strong>
            feature. This feature allows you to set up an alarm that requires scanning a specific barcode or QR code to
            dismiss.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The camera is used for real-time barcode/QR code detection using Google ML Kit's on-device barcode
                scanning.</li>
            <li>When you register a barcode for the Barcode Challenge, <strong>a photo of the barcode is captured and
                    saved locally</strong> on your device. This image serves as a reference so you can easily find and
                scan the correct barcode to dismiss your alarm.</li>
            <li>Barcode images are stored <strong>only on your device</strong> in the App's private storage. They are
                <strong>never uploaded, transmitted, or shared</strong> with any server, third party, or external
                service.</li>
            <li>You can delete saved barcode images at any time by removing the associated alarm or clearing the App's
                data.</li>
            <li>All barcode processing happens <strong>entirely on your device.</strong></li>
            <li>Camera permission is <strong>optional</strong>. The App functions fully without it if you do not use the
                Barcode Challenge feature.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>5. Permissions Explained</h2>
        <p>The App requests the following Android permissions, all of which are used solely for core alarm
            functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Schedule Exact Alarm / Use Exact Alarm:</strong> Required to trigger alarms at the precise time
                you set.</li>
            <li><strong>Post Notifications:</strong> Required to display alarm notifications when an alarm rings.</li>
            <li><strong>Foreground Service (Media Playback):</strong> Required to play the alarm sound reliably, even
                when the App is in the background.</li>
            <li><strong>Wake Lock:</strong> Required to wake the device screen when an alarm fires.</li>
            <li><strong>Receive Boot Completed:</strong> Required to re-schedule your alarms after the device restarts.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Vibrate:</strong> Required to vibrate the device when an alarm rings (if enabled in settings).
            </li>
            <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Optional. Used only for the Barcode Challenge feature (see Section 4).</li>
            <li><strong>System Alert Window:</strong> Required to display the alarm screen over other apps and on the
                lock screen.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Full Screen Intent:</strong> Required to show the full-screen alarm activity when the device
                screen is off.</li>
            <li><strong>Request Ignore Battery Optimizations:</strong> Ensures alarms fire reliably and are not delayed
                by battery optimization.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            The App uses <strong>Google ML Kit Barcode Scanning</strong> for on-device barcode recognition. This library
            processes data <strong>entirely on your device</strong> and does not send any data to Google or any external
            server. No other third-party services, SDKs, analytics platforms, or advertising networks are integrated
            into the App.
        </p>
        <h2>7. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            We do <strong>not share</strong> any data with third parties. Since the App does not collect any personal
            data and does not have internet permission, there is no data to share, sell, or transfer.
        </p>
        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            The App does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of
            13. Since the App collects no personal data whatsoever, it is safe for users of all ages.
        </p>
        <h2>9. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            All data generated by the App is stored locally on your device using Android's built-in secure storage
            mechanisms. Since no data is transmitted over the internet, there is no risk of data interception during
            transmission.
        </p>
        <h2>10. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>
            All App data is stored locally on your device. You can delete all data at any time by:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clearing the App's data through your device's Settings → Apps → Loud Alarm → Storage → Clear Data.</li>
            <li>Uninstalling the App, which automatically removes all associated data.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an
            updated "Effective Date." We encourage you to review this page periodically for any updates.
        </p>
